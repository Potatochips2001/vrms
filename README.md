### Example

The molar mass of THC is 314.45 g/mol; we have to convert this to kg/mol to get the kg/mol (just multiply by 1k is all you need to do) <br/>

Now plug in the formula and you get the velocity in meters per second (which is 152.5 m/s at room temperature [20 C]); <br/>

We can do this to nicotine as well, which returns 212.3 m/s.
